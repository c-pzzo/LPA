A young woman, Sarah, enters, seeking refuge from the rain and the bustle of the city. The warmth of the shop envelops her as she approaches the counter. The barista, a man with kind eyes and a neatly trimmed beard named Liam, greets her with a gentle smile. Sarah orders a latte, intrigued by the unique blend of beans Liam describes. As she waits, she observes the meticulous care with which he prepares her drink, his movements precise and practiced. The steam wand hisses, creating a velvety microfoam that Liam pours into the cup with an artist's touch. He presents the latte to Sarah, a delicate work of art with a heart etched in the foam. She takes a sip, the rich, smooth flavor awakening her senses. The gentle hum of conversation and the clinking of cups create a soothing ambiance. Sarah settles into a worn leather armchair by the window, enjoying the simple pleasure of her coffee and the feeling of being present in the moment.

    "  - \"characters_involved\": Make a list of the characters that are mentioned during the scene. If unclear return an empty list.\n",
    "  - \"setting_involved\": Generate a dictionary outlining the setting featured in the panel. . Each dictionary should contain three key-value pairs: \"setting\" for the setting itself, \"perspective\" for whether it's observed from an \"interior\" or \"exterior\" perspective, and \"location\" for whether it's located within a \"building\" or \"outdoor space\". Ensure to only include one of the settings that have been previously specified. \n",

    "* Panels: \n",
    "  - Visual Description: Provide detailed descriptions for the artist, covering the development of the scene, character appearances, and actions.\n",
    "  - Segmented Panels: Break the script into numbered panels, each depicting a specific action or moment.\n",
    "  - Character Development: Include detailed character descriptions such as physical appearance, attire, and personality traits. Describe character gestures that are easy to watch and understand. Utilize pantomime to vividly depict the character's actions and expressions, enhancing the narrative through silent, expressive motions.\n",
