    Starting Point: Choose a story premise that aligns with the goal of a `{p0['goal']}` in the genre `{p0['genre']}` and with the purpose of `{p0['category']}`. Here are your options:
    
    * "What if?": Explores reality-based issues and fabrications, focusing on fundamental human concerns like fear and curiosity. Teaches the audience how to handle threats.
    * "Let me tell you what happened to": Relates a private event involving a relatable character, sharing intimate experiences with the audience.
    * "Our protagonist is thrown into this new adventure": Features a well-defined character facing a straightforward, challenging adventure. This premise involves simple problems and one-dimensional characters.
    * "Have you heard about...?": Centers around a joke that leads to an unexpected conclusion, utilizing humor techniques like irony, wordplay, and misdirection. Starts with a prologue.
    
    Script Framework: Structure your script as a JSON object with the following keys:
    
    * "title": Place only once an appropriate title for the story at the beginning of the JSON object.
    * "characters": List characters using upper case for character names. Describe them on detail and include some background that would serve the storyline.
    * "settings": Describe the settings where and when the storyline takes place. If historical context isn't provided, assume a current day setting. Characters are free to roam through multiple settings if the storyline is large. 
    * "panels": Array of objects, each object representing a panel in the comic. The panels should contain:
      - "panel_number": Mandatory. Numeric identifier for each panel.
      - "panel_description": Mandatory. Provide a detailed graphic narration of the scene, including character appearances and actions.
      - "characters_involved": Make a list of the characters that are mentioned during the scene. If unclear return an empty list.
      - "setting_involved": Generate a dictionary outlining the setting featured in the panel. . Each dictionary should contain three key-value pairs: "setting" for the setting itself, "perspective" for whether it's observed from an "interior" or "exterior" perspective, and "location" for whether it's located within a "building" or "outdoor space". Ensure to only include one of the settings that have been previously specified. 
      - "captions": Optional. Use "CAPTION:" followed by the text to add context such as time, location, or background information.
      - "dialogue": Optional. Use the format 'CHARACTER NAME: dialogue text' for speaking characters. Use "NO POINTER:" for speaking characters not yet introduced.
    vague_idea
    
    Detailed Guidelines:
    * Panels: 
      - Visual Description: Provide detailed descriptions for the artist, covering the development of the scene, character appearances, and actions.
      - Segmented Panels: Break the script into numbered panels, each depicting a specific action or moment.
      - Character Development: Include detailed character descriptions such as physical appearance, attire, and personality traits. Describe character gestures that are easy to watch and understand. Utilize pantomime to vividly depict the character's actions and expressions, enhancing the narrative through silent, expressive motions.
      - Captions Usage: Use captions to add context, such as time, location, and background information.
      - Genre and Historical Context: Maintain consistency with the chosen genre and historical context.
      - Emotional Engagement: Craft scenes that evoke emotions aligned with the genre, enhancing character interactions and visual storytelling.
      - Storytelling Structure: Ensure the script follows a linear progression, integrating flashbacks or past references seamlessly when necessary.
      - Main Storyline: Develop a compelling main storyline to guide the narrative.
      - Character Design and Imagery: Focus on creating visually memorable characters and scenes.
      - Dialogue and Interaction: Use dialogue to advance the plot, develop characters, and reveal relationships and motivations.
      - Purpose: Your script should aim to meet the projectâ€™s goal, fit within the specified genre, and fulfill the intended category.
