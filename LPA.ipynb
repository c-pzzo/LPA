    "  - Main Storyline: Develop a compelling main storyline to guide the narrative.\n",
    "  - Character Design and Imagery: Focus on creating visually memorable characters and scenes.\n",
    "  - Dialogue and Interaction: Use dialogue to advance the plot, develop characters, and reveal relationships and motivations.\n",
    "  - Purpose: Your script should aim to meet the project’s goal, fit within the specified genre, and fulfill the intended category.\n",
